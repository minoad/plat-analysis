# Architectual Documentation

## Functional Requirements

Document Processing: Handle various document types, including homeowners association restriction documents and historical newspaper clippings.

Information Extraction: Extract and store pertinent information from documents.

Image Processing: Incorporate sophisticated image extraction techniques to handle document images.

Text Analysis: Develop and perform text classification, sentiment analysis, and other text analysis tools.

Multi-Database Support: Store data across multiple database systems, such as relational databases and NoSQL databases.

## High-Level Architecture

Here's a high-level architecture diagram (conceptual representation):

User Interface: Allows users to upload documents, view extracted data, and interact with analysis results.
Document Processor: The core module that manages document extraction, processing, and text analysis.
Image Processing Module: Handles image extraction techniques for processing document images.
Analysis Module: Houses text classification, sentiment analysis, and other text analysis tools.
Database Layer: Manages storage across multiple database systems, providing flexibility and redundancy.
API Gateway: Serves as an interface between the user interface and back-end modules.
Notification System: Provides users with updates on processing status and other significant events.

## UML Diagrams

### Use Case Diagram

- Uploading documents
- Viewing extracted data
- Running text analysis
- Receiving notifications

### Class Diagram

Represents system classes and relationships, including:
Classes such as Document, Image, TextAnalysis, Database, and User.
Relationships between classes, e.g., Document references Image and TextAnalysis.
Inheritance, such as Database being an abstract class with different subclasses (e.g., RelationalDatabase and NoSQLDatabase).

### Sequence Diagram

Illustrates the interactions between objects during document processing and analysis:
Document upload, extraction, and analysis sequences.
Interactions between DocumentProcessor, ImageProcessingModule, and AnalysisModule.

Communication between the system and the various database systems.

### Activity Diagram

Depicts the flow of activities within the system:
Steps involved in document processing, image extraction, and text analysis.
Parallel and sequential tasks for different processing phases.

## Data Model

Entity-Relationship (ER) Diagram:

Represents entities such as Document, ExtractedData, and AnalysisResult.
Relationships between entities, such as Document referencing ExtractedData and AnalysisResult.
Attributes of each entity, including primary and foreign keys.
Database Schema:

Descriptions of tables, columns, data types, and relationships for the databases.
Considerations for data normalization and indexing to optimize performance.

## API Documentation

API Endpoints: Define endpoints for document upload, retrieval of extracted data, and analysis results.
Request/Response Formats: Document request parameters, expected response data, and error codes.
Authentication and Authorization: Describe mechanisms for securing access to APIs.

## User Interface Design

Provide wireframes and mockups for key screens such as:
Document upload and processing pages.
Extracted data and analysis results pages.
User settings and configuration options.

## Testing Plan

Unit Tests: Test individual functions and methods within modules.
Integration Tests: Test interactions between modules and components.
End-to-End Tests: Simulate complete workflows from document upload to data retrieval.
Performance Tests: Assess system performance under various loads.
Security Tests: Ensure data integrity and protect against unauthorized access.

## Conclusion

These architectural documents provide a framework for the development of your project, helping to ensure the successful implementation of all its features. By organizing and visualizing different aspects of the system, you can maintain focus on meeting the project's objectives and facilitate clear communication among team members and stakeholders.
